### **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

- **Why it's a good fit**:

  - LSTMs are specifically designed for sequential data, like time series.
  - They handle long-term dependencies well, making them suitable for capturing trends and seasonality in stock data.
  - They mitigate the vanishing gradient problem better than vanilla RNNs, which is essential for time series data with long histories.

- **Why not GRU**:

  - GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) are simpler and computationally faster but might not capture complex patterns in stock price data as effectively as LSTMs, particularly if the sequence length is long.

- **Why not Transformer-based models**:
  - Transformer-based models, while powerful, require larger datasets and more computational resources due to their attention mechanism.
  - For small datasets like the one we are using, Transformers can overfit and may not perform better than LSTMs or GRUs.

Let’s break this down into components to clarify these concepts and how they relate to LSTMs and time series data:

### **Why LSTM is Better for Your Dataset**

1. **Sequential Dependencies**:
   - Stock prices exhibit temporal dependencies, which LSTM can capture effectively.
2. **Handling Noise**:
   - LSTM can smooth out noise due to its gating mechanisms.
3. **Scalability**:
   - LSTM requires less

### **1. The Vanishing Gradient Problem**

The vanishing gradient problem occurs during backpropagation in neural networks, especially in deep or recurrent architectures.

#### **Why Does It Happen?**

- During training, the gradients (partial derivatives of the loss function) are used to update the weights of the network.
- In deep networks, or in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that process sequential data over many time steps, the gradients are multiplied many times while propagating backward.
- If the activation functions used (like sigmoid or tanh) compress values into small ranges (e.g., between 0 and 1), the gradients can shrink exponentially with each layer or time step.
- Eventually, the gradients become so small they approach zero, making it impossible to update the earlier layers effectively. This is called the **vanishing gradient problem**.

#### **How LSTMs Mitigate It**

- LSTMs have a **gated architecture**: input gates, forget gates, and output gates.
- These gates control how much of the information flows through the network and is retained or discarded.
- The **cell state** acts as a highway for information, allowing gradients to propagate without being multiplied repeatedly, thus avoiding the exponential decay seen in vanilla RNNs.

### **2. Vanilla RNNs**

Vanilla RNNs are the simplest type of recurrent neural networks.

#### **How They Work**

- Vanilla RNNs process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that gets updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.
- Mathematically:
  \[
  h*t = \tanh(W \cdot h*{t-1} + U \cdot x_t + b)
  \]
  Where:
  - \( h_t \): hidden state at time \( t \),
  - \( x_t \): input at time \( t \),
  - \( W, U, b \): learned parameters.

#### **Limitations of Vanilla RNNs**

- They lack the gating mechanisms that LSTMs and GRUs have.
- As a result, they struggle to retain information over long sequences (e.g., data points spread across months or years in a time series).
- They are prone to both the vanishing gradient problem and the **exploding gradient problem** (when gradients grow exponentially, causing instability).

---

### **3. Time Series Data with Long Histories**

Time series data often contains patterns and dependencies over extended periods.

#### **Challenges**

- **Long-term dependencies**: In stock prices, events from weeks or months ago might influence current prices (e.g., quarterly earnings reports).
- **Sequential nature**: Each data point is dependent on prior values, meaning information must propagate across many time steps.

#### **Why Vanilla RNNs Struggle**

- Vanilla RNNs are good at modeling short-term dependencies but fail at learning long-term patterns due to the vanishing gradient problem.
- For instance, if you want to predict a stock price tomorrow based on data from the last year, vanilla RNNs may struggle to effectively use information from 6 or 12 months ago.

#### **Why LSTMs Excel**

- **Cell State**: LSTMs introduce a cell state that runs through the entire sequence, allowing information to flow unimpeded by gradient decay.
- **Gating Mechanisms**: They decide:
  - What new information to add (input gate),
  - What to forget (forget gate),
  - What to output at each step (output gate).

This design ensures that relevant information from earlier time steps is preserved and used effectively, even in long time series.

---

### **Example**

Let’s use an analogy: Imagine you're reading a long novel (a sequence) and trying to summarize it after each chapter (time step).

- **Vanilla RNNs**: Like having no bookmarks. By the time you reach the end, you’ve forgotten details from the early chapters because you can only focus on the last few.
- **LSTMs**: Like using bookmarks to save important plot points as you read. You can refer back to these bookmarks when summarizing the novel.

---

### **Conclusion**

- LSTMs mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by using their gating mechanisms and cell state to preserve relevant information over long sequences.
- Vanilla RNNs, lacking these features, are not well-suited for long time series with dependencies stretching far into the past.
- For tasks like stock price prediction, where trends and patterns over months or years are critical, LSTMs are a much better fit.
