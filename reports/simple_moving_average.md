### **1. What is SMA?**

The **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** is a statistical tool used in time series analysis, especially in stock market studies. It calculates the mean (average) of the stock's closing prices over a specified window (e.g., 20 days).

**Formula for SMA:**
\[
SMA = \frac{\text{Sum of closing prices over the last N days}}{N}
\]

For a 20-day SMA:

- Each point on the SMA line represents the average of the closing prices over the last 20 days.

### **2. Why Compare SMA with Closing Price?**

- **Smoothing Trends:** The SMA smooths out short-term fluctuations in stock prices, making it easier to identify trends over time.
- **Identifying Momentum:** Comparing the **Closing Price** with the SMA helps assess the stock's momentum:
  - If the closing price is above the SMA, it may indicate an **uptrend**.
  - If the closing price is below the SMA, it may indicate a **downtrend**.
- **Support and Resistance Levels:** Traders often use SMA as dynamic support or resistance levels.

### **3. What is the Window?**

The **window** specifies how many previous data points (days) are considered to calculate the moving average. A **20-day SMA** means:

- For each day, the average is calculated using the closing prices of the previous 20 days.

#### Observations:

- **Crossovers:** Points where the closing price crosses the SMA are important signals:
  - **Closing Price crosses above SMA:** Indicates a potential **buy signal** (uptrend starting).
  - **Closing Price crosses below SMA:** Indicates a potential **sell signal** (downtrend starting).
- **Trend Identification:**
  - If the SMA is consistently rising, it indicates an **uptrend** in the stock.
  - If the SMA is consistently falling, it indicates a **downtrend**.
- **Volatility:** The distance between the closing price and SMA gives a sense of market volatility.
